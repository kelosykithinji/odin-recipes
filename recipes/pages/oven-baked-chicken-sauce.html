        <h1> Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li> Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
            <li> 1 cup white wine</li>
            <li> 1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
             <li> 1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven</li>

                <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
<li>Season the Chicken:</li>

<p>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</p>
<li>Sear the Chicken:</li>

<p>In an oven-safe skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breasts for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>
<li>Prepare the White Wine Sauce:</li>

<p>In the same skillet, add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Pour in the white wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze it. Allow the wine to simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.</p>
<li>Add Chicken Broth and Herbs:</li>

<p>Stir in the chicken broth, dried thyme, and dried rosemary. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</p>
<li>Make a Roux:</li>

<p>In a small bowl, mix the flour with a few tablespoons of the hot liquid from the skillet to create a smooth paste. Whisk the paste back into the skillet to thicken the sauce.</p>
<li>Finish the Sauce:</li>

<p>Pour in the heavy cream, stirring continuously. Let the sauce simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes until it thickens.</p>
<li>Return Chicken to the Skillet:</li>

<p>Place the seared chicken breasts back into the skillet, coating them with the sauce.</p>
<li>Bake in the Oven:</li>

<p>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</p>
<li>Garnish and Serve:</li>

<p>Once the chicken is done, garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Serve the chicken over rice, pasta, or with your favorite side dishes. Spoon the white wine sauce over the chicken.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
